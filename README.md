# Full Stack Course Directory App, Powered by React & a REST API.

In this project, I have used the popular Javascript library React to create a client for a school database REST API (that I created in a previous project). This project allows users to view a list of all of the courses held in the API, and view all of the details for each course. Users may also register an account, or sign in with an existing account, to create, update and delete existing courses. I have also implemented a number of validation methods to ensure that users cannot update or delete projects that do not belong to them.

## To run the app

    1. Open two terminal windows - one for the client, and one for the api.
    2. Within the first terminal window, navigate to /api using the command "cd /api". Then, "run npm install" to install all project dependencies.
    3. Once completed, run npm start to initiate the REST API.
    4. In the second terminal window, navigate to /client, and again use the "run npm install" command.
    5. When completed, run npm start to launch the client. The app should now load automatically in your browser.

If the app did not load automatically, please visit http://localhost:3000/ to load the client manually.

## Future Additions

There are a number of improvements I would like to add to this app that were not prerequisites of the Treehouse project specification. These include:

1. Pagination for course results
2. "Forgot Password" functionality
3. More responsive mobile design
4. The ability to view all courses by a particular owner
5. Create a profile for each user, with an admin section that allows one to customise their profile etc.
